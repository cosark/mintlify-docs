# App Documentation Guidelines

## Overview

High-quality documentation is essential for user adoption and satisfaction with your application. This guide outlines best practices and requirements for documenting applications submitted to the RepoCloud platform marketplace.

<Note>
  Well-documented applications have higher user satisfaction, fewer support requests, and better overall success rates on our platform.
</Note>

## Documentation Requirements

Every application submitted to RepoCloud must include comprehensive documentation covering the following areas:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Installation Guide" icon="download">
    Instructions for deploying and configuring your application
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feature Documentation" icon="list-check">
    Detailed explanation of application features and capabilities
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Reference" icon="code">
    Complete API documentation if your application provides APIs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Troubleshooting Guide" icon="wrench">
    Solutions for common issues and error conditions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Documentation Format

RepoCloud supports documentation in Markdown format, which should be submitted as part of your application package. Your documentation should follow this structure:

```
/docs
  /getting-started
    installation.md
    configuration.md
    quickstart.md
  /guides
    feature-a.md
    feature-b.md
    migrations.md
  /api-reference
    endpoints.md
    authentication.md
  /troubleshooting
    common-issues.md
    faq.md
  README.md
```

<Tip>
  We recommend using [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com) for documentation, as it provides a beautiful format that's compatible with RepoCloud's documentation system.
</Tip>

## Core Documentation Components

### README.md

The README.md file serves as the landing page for your application documentation and should include:

1. **Application Overview**: Brief description of your application
2. **Key Features**: List of main features and capabilities
3. **Requirements**: System/resource requirements
4. **Quick Start**: Basic steps to get started
5. **License Information**: License details and any usage restrictions

### Installation Guide

Your installation guide should include:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites">
    Required dependencies, environment considerations, and resource requirements

</CardGroup>

### Visual Elements

High-quality documentation should include:

- **Screenshots**: Include annotated screenshots showing interface elements
- **Diagrams**: Provide architecture diagrams, workflows, and process flows
- **Code Blocks**: Use formatted code blocks with syntax highlighting
- **Tables**: Use tables to organize structured information
- **Callouts**: Highlight important notes, tips, warnings, and cautions

<Tip>
  When including screenshots, focus on relevant UI elements and consider using annotations to highlight important areas.
</Tip>

### Navigation

Make your documentation easy to navigate:

1. **Logical Organization**: Group related content together
2. **Consistent Structure**: Use consistent headings and section ordering
3. **Table of Contents**: Include a table of contents for longer documents
4. **Cross-References**: Link to related sections and external resources
5. **Search Optimization**: Use descriptive headings and include common search terms

## Submission Process

When submitting your application, include documentation in the following ways:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Include Docs Directory">
    Include a `/docs` directory in your application repository with all documentation files
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide README">
    Include a comprehensive README.md in the root of your repository
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit Documentation URL">
    If you host documentation externally, provide the URL in your submission
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include Screenshots">
    Upload high-quality screenshots showing your application's interface
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Documentation Review Criteria

During the review process, your documentation will be evaluated based on:

1. **Completeness**: Coverage of all features, APIs, and configuration options
2. **Clarity**: Clear explanations with appropriate examples
3. **Accuracy**: Technical accuracy and currency of information
4. **Organization**: Logical structure and ease of navigation
5. **Visual Elements**: Effective use of screenshots, diagrams, and formatting

<Warning>
  Applications with incomplete or inadequate documentation may be rejected or delayed in the review process.
</Warning>

## Documentation Maintenance

Once your application is approved:

1. **Keep Documentation Current**: Update documentation when you release new features or changes
2. **Version Documentation**: Clearly indicate which documentation applies to which version
3. **Address Feedback**: Update documentation based on user feedback and common support issues
4. **Announce Changes**: Include documentation updates in your release notes
