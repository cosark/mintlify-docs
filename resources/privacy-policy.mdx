## Data Storage and Security

### Where Your Data is Stored

### Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, and applicable legal requirements.

When you delete your account, we may retain certain information to prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze or troubleshoot programs, enforce our terms of service, or take other actions permitted by law. The information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Security Measures

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, accidental loss, alteration, or destruction. These measures include:

- Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Regular security assessments and vulnerability testing
- Access controls and authentication procedures
- Regular backups and disaster recovery planning
- Staff training on data protection and security
- Physical security measures at our facilities

While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We may share your information in the following circumstances:

### With Your Consent

We may share your information when you give us specific consent to do so.

### Service Providers

We may share your information with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf. These third parties have access to your information only to perform these tasks and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.

### Legal Requirements

We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency). We may also disclose your information when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
