## Technical Integration

RepoCloud provides several integration options for Platform Apps:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Docker Container">
    The simplest integration method is to provide a Docker container that can be deployed directly on our platform.

    ```dockerfile
    # Example Dockerfile structure
    FROM node:16-alpine
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm install
    COPY . .
    EXPOSE 3000
    CMD ["npm", "start"]
    ```

    Your app must include a `repocloud.yaml` configuration file that specifies resource requirements, exposed ports, and environment variables.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Helm Chart">
    For more complex applications, especially those requiring multiple services, you can provide a Helm chart.

    ```yaml
    # Example values.yaml structure
    replicaCount: 1
    
    image:
      repository: your-app/image
      tag: latest
      pullPolicy: Always
    
    service:
      type: ClusterIP
      port: 80
    
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 1Gi
      requests:
        cpu: 0.5
        memory: 512Mi
    ```

    Helm charts must be compatible with Kubernetes 1.20+ and include all necessary dependencies.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API Integration">
    If your application is hosted elsewhere, you can integrate via our API.

    ```json
    // Example API integration manifest
    {
      "name": "Your App Name",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "api_endpoints": {
        "authentication": "https://api.yourapp.com/auth",
        "provisioning": "https://api.yourapp.com/provision",
        "management": "https://api.yourapp.com/manage"

        "client_id": "client_id_placeholder",
        "scopes": ["read", "write"]
