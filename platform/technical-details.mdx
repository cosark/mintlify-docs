## Infrastructure Overview

RepoCloud is built on a modern, scalable infrastructure designed to provide reliable and efficient application hosting. Our architecture allows for rapid deployment, seamless scaling, and simplified management of containerized applications.

### Deployment Architecture

<Note>
  RepoCloud uses containerized applications with an orchestration layer, networking stack, storage system, management API, and monitoring system to provide a complete application hosting platform.
</Note>

Our platform is designed with these key components:

- **Container Runtime**: Applications run in isolated Docker containers
- **Orchestration Layer**: Manages container deployment, scaling, and lifecycle
- **Networking Stack**: Handles traffic routing, load balancing, and SSL/TLS termination
- **Storage System**: Provides persistent storage for application data
- **Management API**: Powers the dashboard and enables programmatic control
- **Monitoring System**: Tracks application health and resource usage

## Technical Specifications

### Compute Resources

RepoCloud offers flexible compute resources to accommodate various application needs:

| Tier | RAM | vCPU | SSD Storage | Price (Monthly) |
|------|-----|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1    | 1 GB | 1    | 20 GB       | $3.00           |
| 2    | 2 GB | 1    | 50 GB       | $6.00           |
| 3    | 2 GB | 2    | 60 GB       | $9.00           |
| 4    | 4 GB | 2    | 80 GB       | $12.00          |
| 5    | 8 GB | 4    | 160 GB      | $24.00          |
| 6    | 16 GB | 8   | 240 GB      | $48.00          |
| 7    | 32 GB | 16  | 360 GB      | $96.00          |

All compute resources feature:
- Intel vCPU processors
- NVMe SSD storage
- DDR4 ECC RAM
- 1 Gbps network connectivity

### Networking Capabilities

Our networking infrastructure provides:

- **Automatic SSL**: Free SSL certificates for all applications
- **Custom Domains**: Support for your own domain names
- **CDN Integration**: Content delivery optimization for faster global access
- **DDoS Protection**: Basic protection against common attacks
- **Shared IP**: Applications share IP addresses for efficient resource utilization

<Note>
  RepoCloud uses shared hosting without dedicated IPv4 addresses for regular applications. For workloads requiring dedicated IPs or root access, consider our platform apps like Coolify or Dokploy.
</Note>

### Storage Architecture

Storage on RepoCloud is designed for performance and reliability:

- **Persistent Storage**: Data persists across container restarts and updates
- **Performance Optimization**: NVMe SSDs for high I/O performance
- **Scalability**: Storage can be expanded as needed
- **Backup System**: Application-specific backup mechanisms

## Technical Limitations

While RepoCloud offers substantial flexibility, there are some technical limitations to be aware of:

1. **No SSH/Console Access**: Users interact with instances through the GUI only; terminal access is not provided for regular applications
2. **No Dedicated IPv4**: Applications use shared IP addresses by default
3. **Container Restrictions**: Applications run as containers, not VMs, which limits certain types of customization
4. **Resource Limits**: Each tier has defined resource limits that cannot be exceeded without upgrading

For use cases requiring greater control, our platform apps (Coolify and Dokploy) provide enhanced capabilities including:

- Dedicated IPv4 addresses
- Full root access
- CI/CD integration
- Heroku/Vercel/Netlify-like interfaces

## Application Updates and Management

RepoCloud ensures your applications stay up-to-date and secure:

- **Automatic Template Updates**: Application templates are regularly updated with the latest stable versions
- **One-Click Rebuilds**: Update your instance to the latest version with a single click
- **Configuration Persistence**: Application data and configurations persist across updates
- **Environment Variable Management**: Easily modify application settings through environment variables

## Data Management

Each application on RepoCloud has its own mechanisms for data management:

- **Application-Specific Migrations**: For example, WordPress uses plugins for migrations
- **Built-in Backup Tools**: Many applications include their own backup functionality
- **Data Persistence**: Application data is stored in persistent volumes
