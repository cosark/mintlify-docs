## Platform Architecture

RepoCloud simplifies the deployment and management of open-source applications through a streamlined architecture designed for performance, reliability, and ease of use.

### Container-Based Deployments

All applications on RepoCloud are deployed as containerized instances, which provides several benefits:

  <Card title="Isolation" icon="shield-halved">
    Each application runs in its own isolated environment for enhanced security
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resource Efficiency" icon="leaf">
    Containers share system resources efficiently while maintaining separation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent Environments" icon="clone">
    Applications run in identical environments across development and production
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fast Deployment" icon="bolt">
    Containers can be deployed and scaled in seconds rather than minutes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Managed Infrastructure

RepoCloud handles the underlying infrastructure so you don't have to:

- **Automated updates**: Security patches and application updates are managed automatically
- **Resource management**: CPU, RAM, and storage are allocated dynamically based on your needs
- **High availability**: Infrastructure is designed for redundancy and reliability
- **Network optimization**: Fast connections with built-in CDN capabilities

## Deployment Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Application Selection">
    Browse our catalog of over 200 pre-configured applications and select the one you want to deploy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuration">
    Configure basic settings like resource allocation, environment variables, and domain settings. Most applications have sensible defaults that work out of the box.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deployment">
    RepoCloud automatically provisions the necessary infrastructure, deploys your application container, and configures networking and storage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Management">
    Once deployed, you can manage your application through our intuitive dashboard, including scaling, updates, backups, and monitoring.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Technical Implementation

Under the hood, RepoCloud uses industry-standard technology to ensure reliable and efficient operations:

- **Docker containers**: Applications are packaged as Docker containers for consistency and portability
- **Orchestration**: We use advanced container orchestration to manage deployments, scaling, and availability
- **Storage solutions**: Persistent data is stored using high-performance storage systems with automated backups
- **Networking layer**: Custom networking stack with automatic SSL certificate management and DNS configuration

<Note>
  While RepoCloud abstracts away most of the technical complexity, users do not have direct terminal access (SSH/CLI) to their instances. This design choice allows us to maintain security, reliability, and simplified management.

## Unique Features

### Elastic Hourly Autoscaling

Our elastic hourly autoscaling feature continuously monitors your application's resource usage and automatically adjusts resources as needed:

- Scales up instantly when demand increases
- Scales down when resources aren't needed
- Charges only for the resources you actually use
- Provides significant cost savings compared to fixed-size instances

### Dynamic Application Updates

RepoCloud ensures your applications always run the latest stable versions:

1. We maintain an updated repository of application templates
2. When you click "Rebuild," your instance updates to the latest version
3. Your data remains intact during the update process
4. The update process typically takes only a few minutes
