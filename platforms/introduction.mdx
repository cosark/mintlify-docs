## Platform Apps

While RepoCloud's standard deployment options meet most users' needs, some scenarios require greater control and flexibility. For these cases, we offer "Platform Apps" - specialized applications that provide enhanced capabilities for advanced users.

## What Are Platform Apps?

Platform Apps are specialized deployment options that provide more control and flexibility than standard RepoCloud applications. They function as platforms-within-a-platform, offering deeper access to the underlying system while still benefiting from RepoCloud's managed infrastructure.

Key features of Platform Apps include:

## Available Platform Apps

RepoCloud currently offers two Platform Apps:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Coolify" icon="snowflake" href="/platforms/coolify">
    Self-hosted Heroku/Netlify alternative with a powerful dashboard and extensive application template library
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dokploy" icon="docker" href="/platforms/dokploy">
    Container management platform that simplifies deploying and managing Docker containers
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## When to Use Platform Apps

Platform Apps are ideal for users who:

1. **Need Root Access**: Require shell access for advanced configuration or troubleshooting
2. **Require Dedicated IP**: Have applications that need their own dedicated IPv4 address
3. **Deploy Custom Applications**: Want to deploy applications not in our standard marketplace
4. **Need Advanced CI/CD**: Require integrated continuous integration and deployment workflows
5. **Prefer Familiar Interfaces**: Want experience similar to Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify

<Note>
  While Platform Apps offer more control, they also require more technical knowledge to manage effectively. They're best suited for users comfortable with server administration concepts.
</Note>

## Technical Considerations

When using Platform Apps, be aware of these technical details:

- **Manual Scaling**: Autoscaling is not available for Platform Apps; scaling must be performed manually
- **Resource Requirements**: Platform Apps typically require more resources than standard applications
- **User Responsibility**: With greater control comes more responsibility for security and updates
- **Pricing**: Platform Apps are billed at the same rates as standard applications, but typically consume more resources

## Deployment Process

Deploying a Platform App follows the same general process as standard applications:
