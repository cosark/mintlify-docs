## Platform Apps

While RepoCloud's standard deployment options meet most users' needs, some scenarios require greater control and flexibility. For these cases, we offer "Platform Apps" - specialized applications that provide enhanced capabilities for advanced users.

<Note>
Platform Apps require a paid subscription. They are not available on free accounts.

## Key Features

Platform Apps offer several advantages over standard RepoCloud deployments:

- **Full Root Access**: Complete control over your environment
- **Dedicated IPv4**: Your own dedicated IP address
- **Advanced Networking**: Custom firewall rules, VPN support, and more
- **Higher Resource Limits**: Support for larger applications and databases
- **Custom Runtime Environments**: Install any software or dependencies you need

## Use Cases

Platform Apps are ideal for:

1. Applications with complex dependencies or system requirements
2. Self-hosted services that need root access
3. Development teams that need full control over their infrastructure
4. Projects requiring custom networking or security configurations
5. Applications that don't fit the standard RepoCloud deployment model
