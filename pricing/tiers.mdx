## Resource Tiers Overview

RepoCloud offers flexible resource tiers designed to accommodate a wide range of applications and workloads. Each tier provides a balanced combination of CPU, RAM, and storage resources at a fraction of the cost of major cloud providers.

## Resource Tiers

RepoCloud provides seven resource tiers, each offering progressively more computing power, memory, and storage capacity:

| Tier | RAM | vCPU | SSD Storage | Hourly Price | Monthly Price |
|------|-----|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1    | 1 GB | 1    | 20 GB       | $0.0042      | $3.00         |
| 2    | 2 GB | 1    | 50 GB       | $0.0083      | $6.00         |
| 3    | 2 GB | 2    | 60 GB       | $0.0125      | $9.00         |
| 4    | 4 GB | 2    | 80 GB       | $0.0167      | $12.00        |
| 5    | 8 GB | 4    | 160 GB      | $0.0333      | $24.00        |
| 6    | 16 GB | 8   | 240 GB      | $0.0667      | $48.00        |
| 7    | 32 GB | 16  | 360 GB      | $0.1333      | $96.00        |

## Choosing the Right Tier

When selecting a resource tier, consider these factors:

### Application Requirements

Different applications have different resource needs:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WordPress">
    - **Small Blog**: Tier 1-2
    - **Medium Site**: Tier 3-4
    - **Large Site**: Tier 5+
    - **WooCommerce**: Tier 4+ (depending on product count)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Databases">
    - **Small Database**: Tier 2-3
    - **Medium Database**: Tier 4-5
    - **Large Database**: Tier 6-7
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Development Tools">
    - **Git Repositories**: Tier 2-3
    - **CI/CD Tools**: Tier 3-5
    - **Code Servers**: Tier 3-4
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Content Management">
    - **Small CMS**: Tier 2-3
    - **Medium CMS**: Tier 3-4
    - **Enterprise CMS**: Tier 5+
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Traffic Patterns

Consider your expected traffic patterns:

- **Low Traffic** (< 10,000 visits/month): Tier 1-2
- **Medium Traffic** (10,000-50,000 visits/month): Tier 3-4
- **High Traffic** (50,000-200,000 visits/month): Tier 5-6
- **Very High Traffic** (200,000+ visits/month): Tier 6-7

### Data Processing Needs

Different data workloads require different resources:

- **Basic Data Storage**: Tier 1-3
- **Data Analysis**: Tier 4-5
- **Large Datasets**: Tier 5-7
- **Real-time Processing**: Tier 5-7

## Scaling Between Tiers

RepoCloud makes it easy to scale your resources as your needs change:

### Upgrading Resources

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Instance Settings">
    Go to your application's management page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Scaling Options">
    Click on the "Scale" tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select New Tier">
    Choose your desired resource tier from the available options
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Changes">
    Click "Apply Changes" to update your instance resources
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Most scaling operations occur without downtime or with minimal interruption. Your data and configuration remain intact when scaling between tiers.
</Note>

### Downgrading Resources

You can also downgrade to a lower tier if you find you've over-provisioned:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Resource Usage">
    Monitor your actual resource usage to determine an appropriate tier
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Instance Settings">
    Go to your application's management page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Scaling Options">
    Click on the "Scale" tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Lower Tier">
    Choose a lower resource tier
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Changes">
    Click "Apply Changes" to update your instance resources
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Before downgrading, ensure your application can operate properly with fewer resources. Downgrading to a tier with insufficient resources may cause performance issues or application failures.
</Warning>

## Autoscaling vs. Fixed Tiers

RepoCloud offers two approaches to resource allocation:

### Fixed Tiers

- **Predictable Costs**: Fixed monthly pricing based on the selected tier
- **Guaranteed Resources**: Consistent resource allocation regardless of usage
- **Simplicity**: No need to monitor or manage scaling
- **Best For**: Applications with consistent resource needs

### Elastic Autoscaling

- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for resources actually used
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Resources scale up and down based on actual needs
- **Optimal Performance**: Automatically handles traffic spikes
- **Best For**: Applications with variable resource needs

<Tip>
  For most users, we recommend starting with autoscaling enabled. This allows your application to find its natural resource usage pattern, and you can switch to a fixed tier later if desired.
</Tip>

## Additional Resources

Beyond the base resource tiers, you can also add:

- **Additional NVMe SSD storage**: $0.10 per GB per month
- **Data Transfer In**: $0 per GB (free)
- **Data Transfer Out**: $0.10 per GB
