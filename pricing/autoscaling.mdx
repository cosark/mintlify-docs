## Elastic Hourly Autoscaling

RepoCloud's Elastic Hourly Autoscaling is an intelligent resource management system that automatically adjusts your application's resources based on actual usage, helping you optimize performance while minimizing costs.

## How Autoscaling Works

Traditional cloud hosting requires you to choose a fixed resource tier and pay for those resources 24/7, regardless of actual usage. With RepoCloud's autoscaling:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Real-time Monitoring">
    Our system continuously monitors your application's resource utilization (CPU, RAM, and storage).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dynamic Resource Allocation">
    When demand increases, additional resources are instantly allocated to maintain performance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Optimization">
    During periods of lower activity, resources scale down automatically to reduce costs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hourly Billing">
    You're billed hourly based on the actual resources consumed, rather than a fixed monthly amount.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Resource Scaling

RepoCloud's autoscaling works by dynamically adjusting three primary resources:

### CPU Scaling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How CPU Scaling Works">
    - CPU usage is monitored in real-time
    - When CPU utilization exceeds thresholds, additional CPU cores are allocated
    - During low CPU utilization, resources are reduced to the minimum needed
    - Scaling occurs without interruption to your application
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Benefits of CPU Scaling">
    - Handle processing-intensive tasks efficiently
    - Maintain application responsiveness during peak loads
    - Reduce costs during periods of low computational demand
    - Avoid over-provisioning CPU resources
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Memory (RAM) Scaling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How RAM Scaling Works">
    - Memory usage is continuously monitored
    - When RAM utilization approaches capacity, additional memory is allocated
    - When memory needs decrease, allocation is reduced
    - Scaling ensures your application always has sufficient memory without waste
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Benefits of RAM Scaling">
    - Prevent out-of-memory errors during traffic spikes
    - Support memory-intensive operations when needed
    - Optimize costs based on actual memory requirements
    - Scale memory independently from CPU resources
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Storage Scaling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Storage Scaling Works">
    - Storage usage is monitored
    - Additional storage is automatically allocated as needed
    - You're billed only for the storage you actually use
    - Scaling occurs without application downtime
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Benefits of Storage Scaling">
    - Never run out of disk space unexpectedly
    - Pay only for the storage you utilize
    - Accommodate growing data needs without manual intervention
    - Optimize costs for applications with variable storage requirements
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Real-World Savings Examples

### Example 1: Blog with Variable Traffic

A blog typically receives most of its traffic during business hours and very little overnight:

- **Fixed Tier Approach**: Would require provisioning for peak traffic (4GB RAM, 2vCPU) at $12/month
- **With Autoscaling**: Average resource usage might be only 1.5GB RAM and 0.8vCPU across 24 hours
- **Resulting Billing**: Approximately $4.50/month (62.5% savings)

### Example 2: Business Application with Weekend Drop-offs

An internal business application used primarily Monday to Friday:

- **Fixed Tier Approach**: Requires 8GB RAM, 4vCPU at $24/month
- **With Autoscaling**: Resources scale down by 80% during weekends (28.6% of the month)
- **Resulting Billing**: Approximately $18.85/month (21.5% savings)

### Example 3: E-commerce with Seasonal Peaks

An e-commerce store with significant traffic during holiday seasons:

- **Fixed Tier Approach**: Would need to provision for peak season (16GB RAM, 8vCPU) at $48/month year-round
- **With Autoscaling**: Resources might average 4GB RAM, 2vCPU during regular periods
- **Resulting Billing**: Averaged across the year, approximately $18/month (62.5% savings)

<Tip>
  Applications with highly variable usage patterns typically see the greatest savings from autoscaling, sometimes reaching 70-90% cost reduction compared to fixed-tier pricing.
</Tip>

## Setting Up Autoscaling

Enabling autoscaling for your RepoCloud application is simple:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Instance Management">
    Go to your application's management page in the RepoCloud dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Scaling Options">
    Click on the "Scale" tab to view resource management options
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Autoscaling">
    Toggle the "Elastic Autoscaling" option to enable it
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Resource Boundaries (Optional)">
    Optionally, set minimum and maximum resource limits to control scaling boundaries
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click "Apply Changes" to enable autoscaling for your application
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Autoscaling Controls

When setting up autoscaling, you have several controls to fine-tune the behavior:

### Minimum Resources

Set the minimum resources that your application should always have available. This ensures that your application always has at least a baseline level of performance, even during very low usage periods.

### Maximum Resources

Define the upper limit for scaling to prevent unexpected costs. By setting a maximum, you ensure that your application won't scale beyond your budget, even during unexpected traffic spikes.

### Scaling Sensitivity

Adjust how quickly the system responds to changes in resource demand:

- **High Sensitivity**: Scales quickly in response to small changes in demand
- **Medium Sensitivity**: Balanced approach to scaling (default)
- **Low Sensitivity**: Waits for sustained changes before scaling

## Monitoring and Analytics

## Billing with Autoscaling

With autoscaling enabled, your billing works differently from fixed-tier pricing:

1. **Hourly Metering**: Resources are measured on an hourly basis
2. **Usage Calculation**: We calculate the average resource usage for each hour
3. **Hourly Rate**: Each hour is billed based on the resources consumed during that hour
4. **Monthly Billing**: All hourly charges are aggregated for your monthly bill
5. **Minimum Charge**: A minimum of $3.00 per month applies to all applications

<Note>
  Billing for autoscaled applications is transparent and predictable. You can view detailed usage reports in your dashboard to understand exactly what you're being charged for.
</Note>

## Autoscaling Limitations

While autoscaling is powerful, there are some limitations to be aware of:

- **Platform Apps**: Autoscaling is not available for [Platform Apps](/platforms/introduction) (Coolify and Dokploy)
- **Minimum Charge**: All applications have a minimum charge of $3.00 per month
- **Resource Constraints**: Some applications may have minimum resource requirements to function properly
- **Scaling Delays**: There may be a brief delay (typically seconds) in responding to sudden, extreme spikes in demand

## When to Choose Fixed Resources

While autoscaling works well for most applications, fixed resources might be better in some scenarios:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Predictable Workloads">
    If your application has very consistent resource needs with minimal variation, a fixed tier might provide more predictable billing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Budget Certainty">
    When you need absolute certainty about your monthly costs for budgeting purposes, fixed tiers provide guaranteed pricing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance Guarantees">
    Applications requiring guaranteed resources at all times, regardless of actual usage, may benefit from fixed allocation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Resource-Intensive Applications">
    Applications that consistently use near-maximum resources won't benefit as much from autoscaling.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Optimizing for Autoscaling

To get the most from autoscaling, consider these best practices:

1. **Monitor Usage Patterns**: Understand your application's typical resource usage patterns
2. **Set Appropriate Limits**: Configure minimum and maximum resources based on your application's needs
3. **Design for Variability**: Structure your application to efficiently handle variable resources
4. **Regular Review**: Periodically review scaling analytics to optimize your settings
5. **Test Performance**: Verify that your application performs well at different resource levels

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How quickly does autoscaling respond to traffic spikes?">
    Autoscaling typically responds within seconds to changes in resource needs. For most applications, this is fast enough to handle even sudden traffic spikes without noticeable performance degradation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will my application experience downtime during scaling?">
    Most scaling operations occur without any downtime. In some cases, applications might experience a brief period (seconds) of reduced performance during scaling, but complete downtime is rare.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is billing calculated with autoscaling?">
    Resources are metered hourly, and you're billed based on the average resource utilization during each hour. These hourly charges are then aggregated for your monthly bill.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I set a maximum monthly budget?">
    Yes, by setting maximum resource limits, you can effectively cap your potential spending. Our system will never scale beyond these limits, ensuring you stay within budget.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if my application needs more resources than the maximum I set?">
    Your application will be limited to the maximum resources you've specified. If additional resources are needed beyond this limit, you may need to manually increase your maximum or switch to a higher fixed tier.
