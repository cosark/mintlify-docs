## Pricing Philosophy

RepoCloud is built on the principle that cloud hosting should be powerful, flexible, and affordable. Our pricing model is designed to provide significant cost savings compared to major cloud providers while delivering enterprise-grade performance and reliability.

## Elastic Hourly Autoscaling

Our signature pricing feature is Elastic Hourly Autoscaling, which allows you to pay only for what you actually use.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Traditional Cloud Pricing" icon="server">
    With traditional cloud providers, you pay for peak capacity 24/7, even when your server is idle, leading to wasted resources and higher costs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="RepoCloud Autoscaling" icon="chart-line">
    Our system dynamically adjusts resources based on actual usage, scaling up instantly when needed and down when not required, with per-hour metering.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How Autoscaling Works

1. Your application starts with minimum necessary resources
2. As demand increases, resources scale up instantly without downtime
3. During periods of low activity, resources scale down automatically
4. You're billed hourly based on actual resource consumption

**Example Savings:** Instead of allocating a fixed 16GB RAM instance at $48/month, RepoCloud might adjust your actual usage down to an average of 1GB RAM at $3/month during low-traffic periods, potentially resulting in up to 93% cost savings.

## Resource Tiers

If you prefer predictable, fixed pricing, we offer set resource tiers that you can choose from:

| Tier | RAM | vCPU | SSD Storage | Hourly Price | Monthly Price |
|------|-----|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1    | 1 GB | 1    | 20 GB       | $0.0042      | $3.00         |
| 2    | 2 GB | 1    | 50 GB       | $0.0083      | $6.00         |
| 3    | 2 GB | 2    | 60 GB       | $0.0125      | $9.00         |
| 4    | 4 GB | 2    | 80 GB       | $0.0167      | $12.00        |
| 5    | 8 GB | 4    | 160 GB      | $0.0333      | $24.00        |
| 6    | 16 GB | 8   | 240 GB      | $0.0667      | $48.00        |
| 7    | 32 GB | 16  | 360 GB      | $0.1333      | $96.00        |

<Note>
  All plans include powerful Intel vCPU, NVMe SSD, DDR4 ECC RAM, SSL certificates, custom domain support, 1 Gbps connections, and unlimited bandwidth.
</Note>

## Additional Resources

Beyond the base resource tiers, you can also add:

- **Additional NVMe SSD storage**: $0.10 per GB per month
- **Data Transfer In**: $0 per GB (free)
- **Data Transfer Out**: $0.10 per GB

## Billing Model

RepoCloud operates on a simple, transparent billing model:

- **Hourly Billing**: Resources are metered and billed on an hourly basis
- **Minimum Charge**: $3.00 per month minimum per application
- **No Hidden Fees**: What you see is what you pay
- **No Long-term Contracts**: Pay as you go with no lock-in

When you sign up, you'll receive free deployment hours to test and run your applications. Once these are exhausted, standard pricing applies.

## Cost Comparison

RepoCloud's pricing is designed to be approximately half that of major cloud providers:

## Choosing the Right Plan

When selecting a plan, consider these factors:

1. **Application Requirements**: Different applications have different resource needs
2. **Expected Traffic**: Higher traffic requires more resources
3. **Usage Patterns**: Variable usage benefits most from autoscaling
4. **Budget Constraints**: Fixed plans offer predictable monthly costs

<Tip>
  For most users, we recommend starting with autoscaling enabled. This allows your application to find its natural resource usage pattern, and you can switch to a fixed plan later if desired.
