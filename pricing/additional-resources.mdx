    Choose the type of resource you want to add from the available categories
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Resource">
    Select the specific plan or configuration for your resource
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Changes">
    Review the resource details, pricing, and impact on your overall deployment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm and Apply">

</Note>

## Resource Management Best Practices

To optimize your RepoCloud deployment and manage costs effectively:

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Review your resource usage regularly to identify opportunities for optimization
2. **Right-sizing**: Choose resources that match your actual needs rather than over-provisioning
3. **Consider Autoscaling**: Use [elastic autoscaling](/pricing/autoscaling) when appropriate to balance performance and cost
4. **Scheduled Resources**: For test or development environments, consider scheduling resources to be available only during working hours
5. **Resource Alerts**: Set up alerts for resource usage to avoid unexpected costs

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I change my resources after deployment?">
    Yes, most resources can be adjusted at any time. You can scale up or down as needed, add new resources, or remove existing ones. Changes typically take effect within minutes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How am I billed for additional resources?">
    Additional resources are billed on a monthly basis, prorated for the time they are active. If you add a resource in the middle of a billing cycle, you'll only be charged for the days it was active.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are there long-term commitments for additional resources?">
    No, most additional resources can be added or removed at any time without long-term commitments. Some services like annual SSL certificates have a minimum duration by nature.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I preview the cost impact before adding resources?">
    Yes, the RepoCloud dashboard provides a cost estimate for any resource changes before you confirm them, allowing you to understand the financial impact.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are there discounts for adding multiple resources?">
    Yes, volume discounts are available for customers with multiple instances or resources. Contact our sales team for details on enterprise pricing.
