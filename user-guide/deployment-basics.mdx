## Key Deployment Concepts

### Resource Tiers

RepoCloud offers several resource tiers to accommodate different needs:

| Tier | RAM | vCPU | Storage | Best For |
|------|-----|------|---------|----------|
| 1 | 1 GB | 1 | 20 GB | Small blogs, simple tools, development environments |
| 2 | 2 GB | 1 | 50 GB | Personal websites, small team collaboration |
| 3 | 2 GB | 2 | 60 GB | Production websites, small business applications |
| 4 | 4 GB | 2 | 80 GB | Medium traffic sites, larger databases |
| 5 | 8 GB | 4 | 160 GB | High-traffic websites, data-intensive applications |
| 6+ | 16-32 GB | 8-16 | 240-360 GB | Enterprise applications, large databases |

### Autoscaling vs. Fixed Resources

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Autoscaling" icon="chart-line">
    **Benefits:**
    - Pay only for resources you actually use
    - Automatically handles traffic spikes
    - Scales down during low-activity periods
    - Cost-efficient for variable workloads
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fixed Resources" icon="lock">
    **Benefits:**
    - Predictable monthly costs
    - Guaranteed resources at all times
    - Simpler to budget and plan
    - Better for consistent workloads
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Autoscaling monitors your application's resource usage and adjusts resources in real-time, charging on an hourly basis for what you actually use.
</Note>

## Common Deployment Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does deployment take?">
    Most applications deploy within 3-7 minutes. Larger applications with more complex setups might take longer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I migrate my existing application?">
    Yes, most applications have built-in migration tools. For example, WordPress sites can be migrated using plugins, and databases can be imported through application-specific tools.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I need more resources?">
    You can scale your resources at any time through the management dashboard. Scaling is typically performed without downtime.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use my own domain name?">
