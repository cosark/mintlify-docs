## How It Works

RepoCloud's one-click deployment process simplifies what would traditionally require hours or days of DevOps work into a streamlined, user-friendly experience:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Application">
    Browse our [marketplace](https://repocloud.io/marketplace) of over 200 applications and click on the application you want to deploy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure (Optional)">
    While most applications work with default settings, you can customize resource allocation, environment variables, and application-specific settings if desired.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click the "Deploy" button and RepoCloud will handle everything else, including:
    - Provisioning container infrastructure
    - Setting up networking and DNS
    - Configuring the application with optimal settings
    - Securing the deployment with SSL
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access">
    Once deployment completes (typically in 1-2 minutes), you'll receive a URL to access your application and can begin using it immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Deployment

Once your application is deployed, you can:

1. **Add a custom domain**: Connect your own domain name to your application
2. **Configure settings**: Adjust application settings through the application's admin interface
3. **Monitor usage**: Track resource usage through our dashboard
4. **Scale resources**: Adjust resources up or down as needed
5. **Update**: Keep your application up-to-date with one-click rebuilds

## Limitations

While one-click deployments are powerful, there are some limitations to be aware of:

- **Customization**: Some advanced customizations may not be available through the interface
- **Shell Access**: Direct shell access is not provided for standard applications
- **Custom Software**: Only applications in our marketplace can be deployed with one click

<Note>
  For use cases requiring more control, consider our platform apps like [Coolify](/platforms/coolify) or [Dokploy](/platforms/dokploy), which provide advanced capabilities including root access and custom application deployment.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I deploy multiple applications at once?">
    Each application requires a separate deployment. However, you can deploy as many different applications as needed for your projects.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are my applications isolated?">
    Each application runs in its own isolated container, ensuring that one application cannot affect the performance or security of another.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I migrate existing data to my deployment?">
    Yes, most applications provide ways to import existing data. For example, WordPress has import/export plugins, and databases have import tools.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if deployment fails?">
    If a deployment fails, you won't be charged. Our system will provide information about the failure, and you can try again with adjusted settings if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change settings after deployment?">
    Yes, many settings can be changed through the application's admin interface or through environment variables in the RepoCloud dashboard.
