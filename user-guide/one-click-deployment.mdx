## How It Works

RepoCloud's one-click deployment process simplifies what would traditionally require hours or days of DevOps work into a streamlined, user-friendly experience:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse the Marketplace">
    Explore our [marketplace](https://repocloud.io/marketplace) or view our [catalog of supported applications](/platform/supported-apps) to find the one you want to deploy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an Application">
    Click on an application to view its details, requirements, and available options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    Choose your resource tier, region, and application-specific settings. For most applications, the default settings work well for getting started.
    
    <Note>
      Our platform automatically configures the optimal settings for each application, but you can customize them according to your needs.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Your Application">
    Click the "Deploy" button to launch your application. The deployment process typically takes 1-2 minutes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Deployment

Once your application is deployed, you can:

1. **Add a custom domain**: Connect your own domain name to your application
2. **Configure settings**: Adjust application settings through the application's admin interface
3. **Monitor usage**: Track resource usage through our dashboard
4. **Scale resources**: Adjust resources up or down as needed
5. **Update**: Keep your application up-to-date with one-click rebuilds

## Limitations

While one-click deployments are powerful, there are some limitations to be aware of:

- **Customization**: Some advanced customizations may not be available through the interface
- **Shell Access**: Direct shell access is not provided for standard applications
- **Custom Software**: Only applications in our marketplace can be deployed with one click

<Note>
  For use cases requiring more control, consider our platform apps like [Coolify](/platforms/coolify) or [Dokploy](/platforms/dokploy), which provide advanced capabilities including root access and custom application deployment.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I deploy multiple applications at once?">
    Each application requires a separate deployment. However, you can deploy as many different applications as needed for your projects.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are my applications isolated?">
    Each application runs in its own isolated container, ensuring that one application cannot affect the performance or security of another.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I migrate existing data to my deployment?">
    Yes, most applications provide ways to import existing data. For example, WordPress has import/export plugins, and databases have import tools.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if deployment fails?">
    If a deployment fails, you won't be charged. Our system will provide information about the failure, and you can try again with adjusted settings if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change settings after deployment?">
    Yes, many settings can be changed through the application's admin interface or through environment variables in the RepoCloud dashboard.
