## RepoCloud's Update Philosophy

RepoCloud maintains a repository of application templates that are regularly updated to include the latest stable versions of all applications in our marketplace. Our approach to updates prioritizes:

## The "Rebuild" Feature

The primary method for updating your applications on RepoCloud is through the "Rebuild" feature, which allows you to update your application to the latest version with a single click.

### How Rebuilding Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Update">
    RepoCloud creates a new container with the latest version of your application
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preserve Data">
    Your application data stored in persistent volumes is preserved
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Configuration">
    Your custom configurations and environment variables are applied to the new container
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch Containers">
    Traffic is redirected to the new container, minimizing downtime
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cleanup">
    The old container is removed once the update is confirmed successful
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The rebuild process typically takes just a few minutes, with only seconds of potential downtime during the final switch.
</Note>

## Performing an Update

Updating your application is straightforward:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Instance Management">
    Navigate to your application's management page in the RepoCloud dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Current Version">
    View the current version information displayed in the "Overview" section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Rebuild">
    Click the "Rebuild" button to start the update process
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Action">
    Confirm the rebuild when prompted
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    A progress indicator will show the status of the update
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Update Frequency

RepoCloud regularly updates application templates, but the frequency varies depending on the application:

- **Critical Security Updates**: Applied as soon as they're available
- **Major Version Updates**: Typically within 1-2 weeks of stable release
- **Minor Updates**: Incorporated into our templates on a regular schedule

<Warning>
  While the rebuild process is designed to be safe, it's always good practice to create a backup of critical data before performing any update.
</Warning>

## What Gets Updated

When you rebuild an application, the following components are updated:

- **Application Code**: The core application is updated to the latest stable version
- **Dependencies**: Associated libraries and dependencies are updated
- **Base System**: The underlying container system may be updated for security and performance
- **Configuration**: Default configurations may be updated to reflect best practices

The following elements are preserved during updates:

- **User Data**: All user-generated content and database information
- **Custom Configurations**: Your environment variables and custom settings
- **Domains**: Any custom domains and SSL certificates remain configured
- **User Accounts**: Application user accounts and permissions

## Update Notifications

RepoCloud provides several ways to stay informed about available updates:

1. **Dashboard Indicators**: Visual indicators on your dashboard when updates are available
2. **Email Notifications**: Optional email alerts for critical security updates
3. **Update Logs**: Detailed logs of what's included in each update

## Major Version Updates

Sometimes, applications undergo significant changes between major versions that require special attention:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data Migration">
    Major version updates may include database schema changes that require data migration. RepoCloud attempts to handle these automatically, but some applications may require manual intervention.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Breaking Changes">
    Major updates can introduce breaking changes to APIs or features. Review the update notes carefully before proceeding with major version updates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Plugin Compatibility">
    For applications that support plugins or extensions, major updates may affect compatibility. You may need to update or replace incompatible plugins after updating.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  For applications with extensive customizations or critical business functions, consider testing the update in a separate instance before updating your production environment.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Updates

If you encounter issues during or after an update:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Failed Update">
    If an update fails to complete:
    - Check the error message in the update logs
    - Verify that your application has sufficient resources
    - Attempt the rebuild again after a few minutes
    - Contact support if the issue persists
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Post-Update Issues">
    If your application behaves unexpectedly after an update:
    - Check application-specific logs for errors
    - Verify that your custom configurations are still correctly applied
    - Consider restoring from a backup if available
    - For complex issues, consult the application's documentation or contact support
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reverting Updates">
    RepoCloud does not provide a direct "rollback" feature, as updates often include important security patches. If you need to revert to a previous version:
    - Restore from a backup if available
    - Contact support for assistance with complex cases
