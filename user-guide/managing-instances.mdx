## Instance Management

Once you've deployed an application on RepoCloud, you'll need to monitor, maintain, and manage it effectively. This guide covers all the essential management tasks available through the RepoCloud dashboard.

## Dashboard Overview

The instance management dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your deployed applications and allows you to perform common management tasks:

## Common Management Tasks

### Monitoring Your Instance

RepoCloud provides several monitoring capabilities:

1. **Resource Usage**: Track CPU, RAM, and storage utilization over time
2. **Status Checks**: Monitor application health and uptime
3. **Performance Metrics**: View response times and request handling statistics

<Note>
  Resource usage monitoring is particularly useful when using autoscaling, as it helps you understand how resources are being allocated and billed.
</Note>

### Starting and Stopping Instances

You can control the state of your instance from the dashboard:

- **Start**: Resume a stopped instance
- **Stop**: Pause an instance (billing continues as resources remain allocated)
- **Restart**: Quickly restart an application to apply changes

<Warning>
  Stopping an instance does not stop billing, as resources remain allocated. To stop billing, you would need to delete the instance.
</Warning>

### Backup and Restore

Most applications on RepoCloud have built-in backup and restore functionality:

1. Access your application's built-in backup tools through the application interface
2. Create regular backups of your important data
3. Store backups externally or download them for safekeeping
4. Use the application's restore functionality when needed

For applications without built-in backup tools, we recommend:

- Regularly exporting important data
- Using a version control system for code and configurations
- Documenting your setup for easy recreation if needed

### Deleting Instances

When you no longer need an instance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Backup Important Data">
    Ensure you've backed up any important data from the application
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Instance Management">
    Go to the instance management page for the application you want to delete
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete Instance">
    Click the "Delete" button and confirm the deletion
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Instance deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. All data associated with the instance will be permanently deleted.
</Warning>

## Advanced Management Features

### Managing Access

If your application supports user management:

1. Create secure administrator accounts
2. Set up multi-factor authentication when available
3. Implement proper role-based access control
4. Regularly audit user accounts and permissions

### Performance Optimization

Optimize your application's performance by:

- Monitoring resource usage and scaling appropriately
- Using caching when available in your application
- Optimizing database queries and indexes
- Implementing CDN for static content when appropriate

### Automated Management

Some applications support webhook integrations that allow for automated management:

1. Set up webhooks for events like deployments, updates, or scaling
2. Connect your application to CI/CD pipelines if supported
3. Implement automated backup schedules

## Application-Specific Management

Different applications have different management requirements. Here are some common examples:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WordPress Management">
    - Install security plugins
    - Set up caching for performance
    - Regularly update themes and plugins
    - Implement backup schedules
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Database Management">
    - Monitor database performance
    - Optimize queries and indexes
    - Set up replication if needed
    - Implement backup and recovery procedures
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Web Server Management">
    - Configure caching policies
    - Set up appropriate redirects
    - Monitor error rates
    - Optimize for high traffic
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your instance:

1. Check the application logs for error messages
2. Verify resource utilization to ensure you have enough resources
3. Restart the application if it's unresponsive
4. Check for recent changes or updates that might have caused the issue
5. Consult the [troubleshooting guide](/user-guide/troubleshooting) for common solutions
