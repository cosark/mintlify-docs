## Instance Management

Once you've deployed an application on RepoCloud, you'll need to monitor, maintain, and manage it effectively. This guide covers all the essential management tasks available through the RepoCloud dashboard.

<Note>
  The RepoCloud dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for managing all aspects of your deployed applications.
</Note>

## Dashboard Overview

The instance management dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your deployed applications and allows you to perform common management tasks:

## Common Management Tasks

### Monitoring Your Instance

RepoCloud provides several monitoring capabilities:

1. **Resource Usage**: Track CPU, RAM, and storage utilization over time
2. **Status Checks**: Monitor application health and uptime
3. **Performance Metrics**: View response times and request handling statistics

<Note>
  Resource usage monitoring is particularly useful when using autoscaling, as it helps you understand how resources are being allocated and billed.
</Note>

### Pausing and Deleting Instances

You can control the state of your instance from the dashboard:

- **Pause**: Pause an instance (billing continues at 25% of the normal rate)
- **Resume**: Resume a paused instance to full functionality
- **Rebuild**: Quickly rebuild an application to apply updates

<Warning>
  Pausing an instance reduces billing to 25% of the normal rate, as some resources remain allocated. To stop billing completely, you would need to delete the instance.
</Warning>

### Data Management

We recommend the following practices for managing your application data:

1. Regularly export important data from your application 
2. Store backups externally or download them for safekeeping
3. Use version control systems for code and configurations
4. Document your setup for easy recreation if needed

<Warning>
  RepoCloud does not currently offer automatic backup and restore functionality. You are responsible for managing your own data backups.
</Warning>

### Deleting Instances

When you no longer need an instance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Backup Important Data">
    Ensure you've backed up any important data from the application
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Instance Management">
    Go to the instance management page for the application you want to delete
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete Instance">
    Click the "Delete" button and confirm the deletion
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Instance deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. All data associated with the instance will be permanently deleted.
</Warning>

## Application-Specific Management

Different applications have different management requirements. Here are some common examples:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WordPress Management">
    - Install security plugins
    - Set up caching for performance
    - Regularly update themes and plugins
    - Implement backup schedules
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Database Management">
    - Monitor database performance
    - Optimize queries and indexes
    - Set up replication if needed
    - Implement backup and recovery procedures
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Web Server Management">
    - Configure caching policies
    - Set up appropriate redirects
    - Monitor error rates
    - Optimize for high traffic
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your instance:

1. Check the application logs for error messages
2. Verify resource utilization to ensure you have enough resources
3. Restart the application if it's unresponsive
4. Check for recent changes or updates that might have caused the issue
5. Consult the [troubleshooting guide](/user-guide/troubleshooting) for common solutions
