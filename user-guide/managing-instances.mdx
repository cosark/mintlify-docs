## Instance Management

Once you've deployed an application on RepoCloud, you'll need to monitor, maintain, and manage it effectively. This guide covers all the essential management tasks available through the RepoCloud dashboard.

<Note>
  The RepoCloud dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for managing all aspects of your deployed applications.
</Note>

## Dashboard Overview

The instance management dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your deployed applications and allows you to perform common management tasks:

## Common Management Tasks

### Monitoring Your Instance

RepoCloud provides several monitoring capabilities:

1. **Resource Tier Tracking**: For instances using AutoScale, you can track which resource tier your application is using in real time
2. **Status Checks**: Monitor application health and uptime
3. **Performance Metrics**: View response times and request handling statistics

<Note>
  Resource tier tracking is particularly useful when using autoscaling, as it helps you understand how resources are being allocated and billed on an hourly basis.
</Note>

### Pausing and Deleting Instances

You can control the state of your instance from the dashboard:

- **Pause**: Pause an instance (billing continues at 25% of the normal rate)
- **Resume**: Resume a paused instance to full functionality
- **Rebuild**: Quickly rebuild an application to apply updates

<Warning>
  Pausing an instance reduces billing to 25% of the normal rate, as some resources remain allocated. To stop billing completely, you would need to delete the instance.
</Warning>

### Data Management

We recommend the following practices for managing your application data:

1. Use the application's built-in backup features if available
2. Regularly export important data from your application 
3. Store backups externally or download them for safekeeping
4. Use version control systems for code and configurations
5. Document your setup for easy recreation if needed

<Warning>
  RepoCloud does not offer dedicated backup services. Backups are only available if they are a built-in feature of the application itself. You are responsible for managing your own data backups.
</Warning>

### Deleting Instances

When you no longer need an instance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Backup Important Data">
    Ensure you've backed up any important data from the application
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Instance Management">
    Go to the instance management page for the application you want to delete
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete Instance">
    Click the "Delete" button and confirm the deletion
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Instance deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. All data associated with the instance will be permanently deleted.
</Warning>

## Application Management

Different applications offer different management interfaces within the application itself. You can access these through the application's web interface:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Content Management Systems">
    Most CMS platforms like WordPress provide admin dashboards for managing content, users, themes, and plugins.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Project Management Tools">
    Tools like Jira and Trello offer configuration options through their web interface for workflow customization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="E-commerce Platforms">
    Platforms like WooCommerce and Magento include store management, product catalog, and order processing interfaces.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your instance:

1. Check the application logs for error messages
2. Verify resource utilization to ensure you have enough resources
3. Restart the application if it's unresponsive
4. Check for recent changes or updates that might have caused the issue
5. Consult the [troubleshooting guide](/user-guide/troubleshooting) for common solutions
