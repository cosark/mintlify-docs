## Accessing and Understanding Logs

Logs are a crucial tool for troubleshooting. RepoCloud provides access to application logs through the dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Instance Management">
    Go to your application's management page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Logs Tab">
    Click on the "Logs" tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Application Logs">
    Browse the logs for error messages, warnings, or other relevant information
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter Logs (Optional)">
    Use the search and filter options to find specific information in the logs
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Look for error messages that include terms like "Error", "Exception", "Failed", or "Fatal" in the logs. These often provide valuable clues about what's going wrong.
