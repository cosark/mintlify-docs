## Using Environment Variables

Environment variables are a powerful way to configure your applications without modifying code. They allow you to customize your application's behavior, store configuration settings, and manage sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.

## What Are Environment Variables?

Environment variables are dynamic values that can affect the way running processes behave on a computer. In the context of containerized applications, they provide a way to:

- Configure application settings
- Store API keys and credentials
- Toggle features on and off
- Set configuration options
- Define connection parameters

## Managing Environment Variables on RepoCloud

RepoCloud makes it easy to set, update, and manage environment variables for your applications through a simple web interface.

### Accessing Environment Variables

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Instance Management">
    Go to your application's management page in the RepoCloud  dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Environment Variables">
    Click on the "Environment Variables" tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Current Variables">
    You'll see a list of all currently configured environment variables
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Adding Environment Variables

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Environment Variables">
    Access the Environment Variables section as described above
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add New Variable">
    Click the "Add Variable" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Key and Value">
    Enter the variable name (key) and its value
    
    Example:
    - Key: `DATABASE_URL`
    - Value: `mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/mydatabase`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click "Save" or "Apply Changes" to update your application's environment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Application">
    In most cases, your application will automatically restart to apply the new variables
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Editing and Deleting Variables

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Environment Variables">
    Access the Environment Variables section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit a Variable">
    Click the edit icon next to the variable you want to modify, then update its value
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete a Variable">
    Click the delete icon next to the variable you want to remove
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click "Save" or "Apply Changes" to update your application's environment
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Changes to environment variables typically require an application restart to take effect. RepoCloud automatically handles this for most applications.
</Note>

## Sensitive Information and Security

Environment variables are commonly used to store sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and tokens. RepoCloud implements security measures to protect this data:

- **Encryption**: Environment variable values are encrypted at rest
- **Masked Display**: Sensitive values are masked in the interface (displayed as `••••••••`)
- **Access Control**: Only authorized users can view and modify environment variables
- **No Logging**: Sensitive values are not written to application logs

<Warning>
  Despite these precautions, you should never store extremely sensitive secrets (like private keys) as environment variables. For such cases, consider using a dedicated secrets management solution.
</Warning>

## Common Environment Variables

Different applications use different environment variables, but some common categories include:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Database Connection Strings">
    Variables that define how your application connects to a database:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@hostname:port/database
    DB_HOST=hostname
    DB_USER=username
    DB_PASSWORD=password
    DB_NAME=database
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API Keys and Authentication">
    Variables for third-party service integration:
    ```
    API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
    STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Application Settings">
    Variables that control application behavior:
    ```
    DEBUG=true
    LOG_LEVEL=info
    CACHE_TTL=3600
    FEATURE_X_ENABLED=true
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Email Configuration">
    Variables for email service configuration:
    ```
    SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
    SMTP_PORT=587
    SMTP_USER=user@example.com
    SMTP_PASSWORD=password
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Application-Specific Variables

Each application has its own set of supported environment variables. Here are examples for some popular applications:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WordPress">
    Common WordPress configuration variables:
    ```
    WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=mysql_host
    WORDPRESS_DB_USER=db_user
    WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=db_password
    WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wordpress
    WORDPRESS_TABLE_PREFIX=wp_
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Node.js Applications">
    Common Node.js application variables:
    ```
    NODE_ENV=production
    PORT=3000
    SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
    CORS_ORIGIN=https://example.com
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="PostgreSQL">
    PostgreSQL configuration variables:
    ```
    POSTGRES_USER=postgres
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    POSTGRES_DB=mydb
    PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Check your application's documentation to understand which environment variables are available and what they do. Many applications include a list of supported variables in their documentation.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

Follow these best practices when working with environment variables:

1. **Use descriptive names**: Choose clear, descriptive names for your variables
2. **Separate development and production**: Use different values for development and production environments
3. **Document your variables**: Keep a record of what each variable does and why it's needed
4. **Minimize sensitive data**: Only store sensitive information in environment variables when necessary
5. **Use standard formats**: Follow established formats for connection strings and other structured data
6. **Avoid hardcoding**: Never hardcode values that should be configurable in your application code

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Application Not Recognizing Variables">
    If your application doesn't recognize environment variables:
    - Verify the variable name is correct (including case)
    - Ensure the application has restarted after changes
    - Check application logs for environment-related errors
    - Verify the application is designed to use the variables you're setting
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Syntax Errors">
    Some common syntax issues:
    - Avoid spaces around the equals sign (use `KEY=value`, not `KEY = value`)
    - Be careful with quotes (some values may need to be quoted)
    - Watch for special characters that might need escaping
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes Not Taking Effect">
    If changes don't seem to apply:
    - Manually restart the application after changing variables
    - Check if the application caches configuration and needs a specific refresh
    - Verify you've saved the changes in the dashboard
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
